Minimal API and Auto-Bindings

This is a minimal API with code to demostrate the auto-bindings attributes available in .Net 8.
These attributes are:
- [FromQuery]
- [FromForm]
- [FromBody]
- [FromHeader]
- [FromServices]
- [FromKeyedServices]

There is a post in Spanish explaining the code and how to test the bindings using swagger an Javascript here https://foyland.blogspot.com/2024/04/net-minimal-api-y-auto-bindings.html
